# Homebridge macOS Installer

This project builds the Homebridge macOS installer.

The project aims to deploy Homebridge and the Homebridge UI in a secure and stable way, with no dependencies outside those available in the standard distribution repos. It comes bundled with it's own Node.js runtime and runs Homebridge in an isolated environment as a service user with no sudo / admin priviledges.
